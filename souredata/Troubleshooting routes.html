</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_Routes">Creating Routes</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Difficulty">Difficulty</span></h3>
<ul><li>Add delegates to the destination country to decrease the difficulty. Having a good relation with a country helps in the route creation process.</li>
<li>In countries with low openness, making flights from them by airlines having an HQ in another country are difficult (i.e. if an airline based in the US tried to make a route from an airport in Venezuela, which has an openness of 1). It will be highly beneficial to assign delegates to such countries.
<ul><li>The reason above is also why making routes to these countries are difficult.</li></ul></li>
<li>If you can't seem to still lower the difficulty, you can reduce the frequency which helps (especially with high capacity planes). You can add more later. If necessary, you may need to start with losses in your first 6-12 weeks with the route.</li>
<li>If the difficulty rating exceeds 10, the route is considered "impossible" as you can only assign 10 delegates at a time per negotiation.</li>
<li>Making or editing routes from a foreign base (or a base not in your home country) will always suffer a "Foreign Airline" penalty. Keep that in mind while thinking of where to base.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Updating_Routes">Updating Routes</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Negotiations">Negotiations</span></h3>
<ul><li>While it is reassuring to have the 100% success rate, you may want to reduce the delegates to use more on other routes.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Profits">Profits</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Low_revenue-to-profit_ratio">Low revenue-to-profit ratio</span></h3>
<ul><li>Check your costs on the route (which include Fuel Cost, Crew Cost, Airport Fees, Depreciation, etc.). The highest of these will usually be fuel, service supplies, and compensation depending on the route. Fuel can only be lowered by buying <a href="/wiki/Oil" title="Oil">fuel contracts</a>, service supplies can be lowered by changing the <a href="/wiki/Service_Quality" title="Service Quality">service quality</a>, and compensation can be eliminated by keeping a new fleet.</li>
<li>Inefficient planes (fuel wise) such as the <a href="/wiki/Concorde" title="Concorde">Concorde</a> or the <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvVHVwb2xldl9UdT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=" title="Tupolev Tu (page does not exist)">Tupolev 144D</span> usually need high prices to offset the fuel cost. Keep this in mind when pricing tickets and finding routes.</li>
<li>Longer routes offer higher revenue, but there are higher costs (mostly in fuel). When played right, these long haul (or ultra long haul!) routes can become extremely valuable.</li></ul>
