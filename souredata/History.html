<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="2019">2019</span></h2>
<ul><li><b>March 11th</b>- V2 development starts. Initial ideas include adding a plane cost to a route creation (if there is no plane available), the negotiation system (instead of slots), and LF requirements (i.e. your route has to have reliable LF or it will be deleted by the game).<figure class="thumb show-info-icon" style="width: 300px" typeof="mw:File/Thumb"> <a class="mw-file-description image" href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/airline-club/images/e/e6/Negotiation_Gif.gif/revision/latest?cb=20210811193002"><img alt="Negotiation Gif" class="thumbimage" data-image-key="Negotiation_Gif.gif" data-image-name="Negotiation Gif.gif" data-relevant="1" decoding="async" height="199" src="images/Negotiation_Gif.gif" width="300"/></a> <figcaption class="thumbcaption"> <a class="info-icon" href="/wiki/File:Negotiation_Gif.gif"><svg><use xlink:href="#wds-icons-info-small"></use></svg></a> <p class="caption">Negotiations as they looked in 2019.</p> </figcaption> </figure></li>
<li><b>March 26th</b>- Auto-order/auto-assign planes are added to route creation. The negotiation system officially replaces the slots system, with an animation! (See right)</li>
<li><b>August 5th</b>- Minor changes to the passenger simulation:
<ul><li>Easier to attract business and first class passengers as their quality expectation is lowered</li>
<li>Passengers are slightly less willing to downgrade to a different class</li>
<li>Passengers are less willing to switch airlines for transits (Removed later that day, due to the amount of transit pax lost)</li>
<li>High flight frequency (&gt; 14 per week) will be more attractive to passenger with preference "Swift"</li>
<li>Business and First class passengers are less sensitive to price changes</li>
<li>Code optimization to avoid some redundant calculations</li>
<li>Business and First class passenger favors direct flights more</li></ul></li>
<li><b>August 10th</b>- Game time reduced from 90 minutes to 40-50 minutes through optimization.</li>
<li><b>November 11th</b>- Passenger flight map's memory usage was reduced (as it brought down systems). The chat should no longer disconnect/reconnect as often, duplicate messages after reconnecting, and the framework is upgraded to match the latest game version. Airline status (the colored dots next to the names in the Rivals menu) is also added, as well as the option to see/unsee inactive airlines (Airlines who have not logged in in the last 30 days).</li>

<li><b>December 30th</b>- V1.1 changes are announced/implemented:
<ul><li>A single airplane can now be assigned to multiple routes</li>
<li>Restrict 5 customizable seat configurations per airplane model - the configuration is customizable and specific to each player. For the upgrade, a script will be run to find 5 configurations that matches the existing routes. If more than 5 seat configurations are found, then it will try its best effort to do the matching</li>
<li>Airplanes will be assigned to a home base, and it can only fly routes from that home base. If a base is removed, then the airplanes will be sent to the HQs</li>
<li>Airplanes can switch home base</li>
<li>There will be a soft limit on how many routes can a base support (Not implemented yet)</li>
<li>National and Partnered Airline statuses (originally intended for V2). National gives 10 loyalty boost while partnered gives 5. Both increase the route limit of bases in that country. (Not implemented yet)</li></ul></li></ul>
