<p>To start your airline, you must choose an <a href="/wiki/Airport" title="Airport">airport</a> for your <a href="/wiki/Base" title="Base">HQ</a> to be located in. If you know where you want to start, then go for it, although read the tips below
</p>
<h3><span id="Which_Airport.3F"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Which_Airport?">Which Airport?</span></h3>
<p>There are tons of airports in the game, ranging from large international airports to smaller regional ones. Which ever one you choose depends on however you want to play, so the following circumstances might vary. The following are pros and cons of the different airport sizes.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Country_Gateway_Airport">Country Gateway Airport</span></h4>
<p>These airport is a light purple in color. The airport typically in the country's capital, or big population centers for especially large countries.
</p>
<ul><li>Pros: More likely to have a mix of both international and domestic traffic from airlines abroad and based in the country, route creation to other Gateway Airports is easier</li>
<li>Cons: Competition is very likely (more so in larger airports), there may be lots of other airlines based there</li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Large_Airport">Large Airport</span></h4>
<p>These airports are dark blue and have high population coverage.
</p>
<ul><li>Pros: Large population coverage (which gives more base demand per route), small buffer between international traffic (as it's harder to create a route to a non-gateway airport)</li>
<li>Cons: Less international traffic (especially in countries with low openness)</li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Medium_Airport">Medium Airport</span></h4>
<p>These airports have a somewhat dark blue color, but is lighter than large airports.
</p>
<ul><li>Pros:  Will usually have a small amount of flights to/from the airport</li>
<li>Cons: Smaller amount of passenger demand</li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Small_Airport">Small Airport</span></h4>
<p>These airports are the lightest color on the map, and the most common airport. You need to zoom in to see them.
</p>
<ul><li>Pros: Very unlikely to have competition</li>
<li>Cons: Little demand, unlikely for outside demand, usually has smaller runways and can't fit every plane</li></ul>
<p>Once you are satisfied with the airport you wish to consider, press the airport the the "View Airport" button. One immediate thing to look at is airport rating, in the upper left corner. The airport's difficulty is determined by how challenging the airport and country is, as well as the amount of competition. The more challenging it is, the more capital you will start with (not necessarily more starting cash).
</p><p>Also by starting in a particular airport, you call that country your "Home Country" and get a relationship bonus, as well as determines your relationship with other countries/manufactures. <b>You are not able to change your HQ airport without resting your airline!!</b>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Airline_Profiles">Airline Profiles</span></h3>
<p>When you press the "Build Headquarters" button, you are greeted by three options, Entrepreneurial sprit, A humble beginning, and Revival of past glory. <a href="/wiki/Airline_Profile" title="Airline Profile">Here</a> is more in-depth information of the three profiles.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Entrepreneurial_Spirit">Entrepreneurial Spirit</span></h4>
<p>You begin with nothing but cash. This is a great start for beginners, as it does not put strain on early cashflow from starting loans, and gives freedom to choose the starting aircraft. A downside is you start with no awareness or loyalty in your home airport, as well as starting with a lower starting capital.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="A_Humble_Beginning">A Humble Beginning</span></h4>
<p>While you do gain a small boost to starting capital, some starting aircraft, and a small awareness and loyalty to start with, there is a modest loan to accommodate these. If you feel up to the challenge, go for this option.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Revival_of_Past_Glory">Revival of Past Glory</span></h4>
<p>This start is recommended for experienced players. Overall, you start with a hefty amount of capital to work with and a higher starting awareness and loyalty, but there is a massive loan (~3 to 4 times larger than a humble beginning), which tends to trip people up. It is also recommended that you stay very active to micromanage your routes.
