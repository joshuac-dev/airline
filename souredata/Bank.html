<div class="mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output" dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Though there is no need to deposit or withdraw any money in Airline Club, there is a bank. The bank provides an opportunity for the player to take out loans. Before taking out a loan, the player should take note of the interest rates, which can be seen on the "Loan Options" panel, as well as the Interest Rate History graph.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Loans">Loans</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="New_Loans">New Loans</span></h3>
<p>Loans can be taken out for a term of 52, 104, 156, or 260 <a href="/wiki/Cycle" title="Cycle">weeks</a>. Shorter term loans will charge lower interest rates, but require larger payments each week. To make sure you will have enough cash each week to make the loan payments, it is important to check your Cash Flow Sheet tab in the <a href="/wiki/Office" title="Office">office</a>, <b>not</b> your Income Sheet, as the Income Sheet can be misleading.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Outstanding_Loans">Outstanding Loans</span></h3>
<p>Once a loan is taken out, it will appear in the Outstanding Loans panel. Loan payments will be automatically deducted from your funds each week. You have the option of paying off your loan early for less than the total amount owed. The Early Repayment Fee <b>is included</b> in the Early Repayment Amount shown.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Calculating_Loan_Numbers">Calculating Loan Numbers</span></h3>
<p>To calculate your current remaining principal owned, one can use Early Repayment Amount minus the Early Repayment Fee. To calculate the exact interest one owes if one pays week by week, one can use the remaining payment, then subtract the principal (using the formula above) from it. To calculate the discount by paying off a loan early, one can use the interest if paid week by week minus the early repayment amount. In the following example:
</p>
<figure class="thumb show-info-icon" style="width: 631px" typeof="mw:File/Thumb"> <a class="mw-file-description image" href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/airline-club/images/f/f3/Example_of_a_Loan.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20210718211809"><img alt="Example of a Loan" class="thumbimage" data-image-key="Example_of_a_Loan.jpg" data-image-name="Example of a Loan.jpg" data-relevant="1" decoding="async" height="105" src="images/Example_of_a_Loan.jpg" width="631"/></a> <figcaption class="thumbcaption"> <a class="info-icon" href="/wiki/File:Example_of_a_Loan.jpg"><svg><use xlink:href="#wds-icons-info-small"></use></svg></a> <p class="caption">An example of a loan</p> </figcaption> </figure>
<p>As in the image on the right, the remaining principal owned, in millions, is the 116 (the Early Repayment Amount) - 16 (the Early Repayment Fee) which is approximately 100 (million). The interest owned if paid off week by week is 133 (remaining payment) - 100 (the principal) = 133 (million). Finally, the discount resulted from paying off the loan early can be calculated with 133 (interest owed if paid off week by week) - 116 (Early Repayment Amount) = 17 million.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Interest">Interest</span></h3>
<p>Interest can vary widely, as seen by the interest graph on the left of the page. Whatever interest is shown is for the <b>shortest</b> loan duration, of 52 weeks. Each increment of time will increase the interest by 0.5% (I.e. 10% for 52 weeks, 10.5% for 104 weeks, etc.), meaning you pay in interest the longer the term is.
