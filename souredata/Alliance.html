<h1>Alliance</h1>
<hr>
<div class="mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output" dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>An alliance is a group of airlines that work together to help each other expand their flight network. 
</p>
<h2><span id="Creating.2FJoining_an_Alliance"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating/Joining_an_Alliance">Creating/Joining an Alliance</span></h2>
<p>You can join existing alliances, or create your own.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating">Creating</span></h3>
<ol><li>Go to menu slider, and find alliances (4th from the bottom).<figure class="thumb show-info-icon" style="width: 180px" typeof="mw:File/Thumb"> <a class="mw-file-description image" href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/airline-club/images/1/17/Creating_an_Alliance.png/revision/latest?cb=20210528115919"><img alt="Creating an Alliance" class="thumbimage" data-image-key="Creating_an_Alliance.png" data-image-name="Creating an Alliance.png" data-relevant="1" decoding="async" height="47" src="images/Creating_an_Alliance.png" width="180"/></a> <figcaption class="thumbcaption"> <a class="info-icon" href="/wiki/File:Creating_an_Alliance.png"><svg><use xlink:href="#wds-icons-info-small"></use></svg></a> <p class="caption">Name for a random alliance.</p> </figcaption> </figure></li>
<li>Click on the gear, then type in the name of the alliance. Then press the check mark next to/under the text. <b>You can not change this once confirmed!</b></li>
<li>Wait for people to request to join, or advertise your alliance in the chat, Discord, or the <a class="external text" href="https://airlineclub.createaforum.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">forums</a>.</li>
<li>To accept new members, click the check mark next to the applicant text. To reject an applicant, you can press the X button. Before you accept them (press the cancel on the confirmation screen), you can look at the info of the airline in question.<br/></li></ol>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Joining">Joining</span></h3>
<ol><li>Look for the alliance you want to join. The alliance can't have the following: 12 members (not counting applicants), no other airline has any bases where another airlinbe has a base, and no airlines HQ is where another airline has an HQ. However, 1 base and 1 HQ in the same airport is intentionally allowed and used as a strategy by many top alliances.</li>
<li>Wait for them to accept (or reject) you.</li>
<li>You're accepted! (or rejected, then just repeat the steps with a different alliance.) Note that some (especially higher-ranked) alliances recruit exclusively on the Airline Club discord, and they will only accept you if a leader/co-leader on discord gives you the all clear to apply.</li></ol>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Benefits">Benefits</span></h2>
<ul><li>Passengers are more likely to take flights with other alliance members (via code (IATA) sharing), in the form of <a href="/wiki/Demand" title="Demand">transfer passengers</a></li>
<li>Reputation boost, minimum of 5, up to 50 (only applies to alliances with three or more members)</li>
<li>Private chat for alliance members (for either planning or talking)</li>
<li>Map showing all alliance flight routes (like the rival map).</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Alliance_Ranking">Alliance Ranking</span></h2>
<p>Based on the number of <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvQ2hhbXBpb25fcG9pbnRzP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==" title="Champion points (page does not exist)">champion points</span> the alliance has, your alliance will be ranked (where the more points you have, the better). The higher up in the leader board you are, the more reputation you will gain (from the alliance), up to 50 extra points. Like mentioned above, these benefits only apply to "registered" alliances (alliances with 3+ members).

<h2><span id="Alliance_Descriptions.2FDetails"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Alliance_Descriptions/Details">Alliance Descriptions/Details</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Oneworld">Oneworld</span></h3>
<p>Oneworld has been the #1 alliance since the early days of v2, with <a href="/wiki/CSA_Czech_Airlines" title="CSA Czech Airlines">CSA Czech Airlines</a> as its leader, creating the alliance in week 1 of the game. It's current co-leaders consist of ForeverAir, WestPac Airlines, and <a href="/wiki/American_Airlines" title="American Airlines">American Airlines</a>(CSA's Alt). Oneworld has a vast majority of the top airlines, although Bumbum has started to catch up. Oneworld is known for their "Oneworld Prices", coming from their notoriously high prices on their routes because of their great network. Oneworld dominates most major airports in high-income countries. They are also famous for having massive planes like the A380 or A350-1000 on lots of routes, and consistently dominating the top 20 routes charts as well as the top 20 lounges chart.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ciels_du_Bumbum">Ciels du Bumbum</span></h3>
<p>Bumbum was named one of the founding members, Meow's obsession with the word Bumbum. Originally, the alliance was Paw Pals, but after Vulkan Airlines/Cosmic Airways left, the alliance was reorganized with new members into Onyewowwd, an owo play on the Oneworld name. Later, due to PR concerns, the name was changed to Societe du Bumbum. After that, it was changed a third time, this time to Ciels du Bumbum. Bumbum is one of the most hated alliances due to price wars with other alliances, and includes many top airlines such as American Chicken, Air France KLM, and Billiam Air.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sky_Team">Sky Team</span></h3>
<p>Sky Team is most famous for it's leader, AFKLM, among others, including To the Sky Airlines (which is rumored to be his brother, but never confirmed), as well as Odessair and Biliam (who was one of the few airlines that really got ahead after joining mid-game, since he was the discoverer of the sheer amount of 1.5 rep airports in the US). AFKLM is extremely impressive and is at "oneworld-level"; however, it is conflicting HQ with Air Italy which Oneworld is probably keeping as PR since he has a good relationship with dev (and is the maintainer of the AC Discord Verification Bot), as well as possible emotional connetions with other members. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Latin_Team">Latin Team</span></h3>
<p>Latin Team rised due to the top alliances not giving much focus on the low-income countries, and in particular, the latin american countries as well as Africa. In the early days, Oneworld and Paw Pals (obviously, oneworld won in the end) were fighting for the premium pax in the high income countries, neglecting other low income countries that had high rep. Latin Team also holds the most impressive player, AAA (Africair/Azul/Atlantica), not to be confused with the TripleA alliance, and at its peak, was also the only single player to have 3 airlines in the top20 section by rep. Africair was also one of the two airlines (the other being Pizza Air) to ever beat CSA in rep since the very early stages of the game. Unfourtunately, due to inactivity, AAA went bankrupt/rebuilt, and after that, it has never risen to the same level as before.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Unisky">Unisky</span></h3>
<p>Unisky is the developer's alliance and both of his accounts are in it. Following a period of inactivity, his main acount Air Chocobo went bankrupt, who was the only leader of the alliance, and as a result, disbanded. Unisky is currently reforming so make sure to reach out to dev on discord if you're interested! (updated 9/17/22)
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Golden_Sun">Golden Sun</span></h3>
<p>Golden Sun is known for Fly or Die, who can be referred to the "AC Mechanics Guy". He knows just about every detail about AC game mechanics He is famous for his dedication to educating new players, and helping them succeed, even writing a public guide on the AC Wiki <a href="/wiki/Fly_or_die%27s_Guide" title="Fly or die's Guide">Fly or die's Guide</a>. Golden Sun also has the most calculators and has the best understanding of AC's mechanics compared to any other alliance likely because of Fly or Die.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Trivia">Trivia</span></h2>
<ul><li>In V1, high-ranking alliances also increase your max flight frequency (but that was removed, due to there being no need for strict frequency limits).
<ul><li>Reputation boosts were also smaller, from 2 to 20 (considering how championing a small country gave you 1 point at most, this is very small).</li></ul></li>
<li>If you were an alliance applicant, you could see and use the alliance chat (and thus, plans/conversations). That has been removed in the new version.</li>
<li>There were two users, Flying For Fun and SPA, who created quite a few airlines (SPA had at least 15 different airlines, FFF had 12) and placed them over one alliance. Nowadays, creating that many accounts is frowned upon.<br/></li></ul></div>
