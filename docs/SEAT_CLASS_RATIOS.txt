AIRCRAFT SEAT CLASS SPACE RATIOS - QUICK REFERENCE
===================================================

Question: How many economy seats does each class replace?

ANSWER:
-------
✓ 1 Business Class seat = 2.5 Economy seats
✓ 1 First Class seat    = 6 Economy seats

This means:
- Business class uses 2.5x the space of economy
- First class uses 6x the space of economy

Example: Aircraft with 300 space units
---------------------------------------
All Economy:   300 seats
All Business:  120 seats (120 × 2.5 = 300)
All First:      50 seats (50 × 6 = 300)

Mixed Config:
  10 First    (60 space)
+ 20 Business (50 space)
+ 190 Economy (190 space)
= 300 total space units
