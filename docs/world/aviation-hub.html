        <h1>Aviation Hub</h1>
        
<p>In v2.2, released August 23, 2025, the new aviation hub was added. Details below, summarized by Gemini.</p>
<p>1. Basic Requirements to be a Hub:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Enough Passengers:
An airport must have at least 10,000 passengers. If it has fewer, its hub strength is 0.
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Calculating the Hub Strength:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The "Ratio" Score:
The code looks at the airport's total number of passengers (
pax
) compared to the number of people who want to fly directly from that airport (
directDemand
).
<ul>
<li>
If there's
no direct demand
(
directDemand
is 0), the ratio score is a fixed value of 20. This is a special case to give airports with no direct flights a chance to be a hub.
</li>
<li>
If there
is direct demand
, the code calculates the ratio:
total passengers / direct demand
.
<ul>
<li>
If this ratio is less than 2, the hub strength is 0. This means the airport is mainly serving people flying directly, not connecting passengers.
</li>
<li>
If the ratio is 2 or more, the code uses a mathematical formula (a logarithm) to calculate the ratio score. This formula rewards airports with a very high ratio (meaning they have lots of connecting passengers) but caps the score at 20.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
The "Passenger" score is calculated by taking the airport's passenger count, but capping it at 500,000, and then dividing it by 75,000. This means larger airports get a bigger boost to their hub strength, but it doesn't increase infinitely.
</li>
</ul>
<p>What the Hub Strength Does:</p>
<p>For every point of "Aviation Hub Strength" an airport has:</p>
<ul>
<li>
It increases the airport's reputation by 0.25.
</li>
<li>
It increases the population it serves by 20,000.
</li>
<li>
It increases the airport's income by $100.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Direct demand</h3>
<p>You can use the passenger score of airports, for airports without aviation hub, to calculatw their exact total direct demand. This is equal to required passengers / 2, if the requirement > 10,000 passengers.</p>
