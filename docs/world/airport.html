        <h1>Airport</h1>
        
<p>An</p>
<p>airport</p>
<p>is the origin and destination (landing) point of</p>
<p>flights</p>
<p>on the</p>
<p>map</p>
<p>. There are a total of 3,819 airports currently in the game.</p>
<p>The various airport colors.</p>
<h2>Map View</h2>
<p>The world map shows all airports, only large and gateway airports appear in a large zoom; to view smaller airports, one must zoom in further.</p>
<h3>Airport Colors</h3>
<p>Airports appear on the map in shades of blue, where the darker that blue is, the more population the airport covers. A purple airport is a Gateway Airport, which gives international flights more demand as well as making it easier to negotiate. Note that Gateway Airports can vary widely in size.</p>

<h3>Airport Rating</h3>
<p>The Airport Rating section shows information about the difficulty a player would have when expanding their airline to that particular airport. This section details the airport rating, country rating, amount of competition, charms, and estimated difficulty.</p>
<h3>Your Airline Headquarters/Base</h3>
<p>Headquarters and Bases act as hubs where flights from your airline originate and end. Each HQ/</p>
<p>base</p>
<p>can be upgraded up to a scale of 15. Each upgrade will increase the staff; raise the frequency cap for the number of flights along a route, and increase the upkeep cost which impacts your "Cash Flow/Income".</p>
<p>The Base or Headquarters section details the established bases that the player has at an airport. If no headquarters have been placed, the player is given the option to place their headquarters at the airport. Players may place bases at additional airports.</p>

<h2>Lounge</h2>
<p>Lounges attract more premium passengers (Business & 1st Class) to your routes.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>To begin a lounge, you must have a certain amount of passengers, depending on the size of your airport. If the size of the airport is 4 or less, you must be the most amount of passengers transported. Otherwise use the following table:</p>
<p>To start or upgrade your lounge, it costs $50,000,000 per level ($50,000,000 for level 1, $100,000,000 for level 2, etc.) up to level three.</p>
<h3>Costs</h3>
<p>To run a lounge, there are two main costs: a per passenger and a weekly maintenance.</p>
<p>Per passenger, it costs $50. However, you receive a $100 payment per passenger (meaning you earn $50 per passenger)</p>
<p>The formula for upkeep is as follows:</p>
