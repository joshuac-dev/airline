        <h1>V2.1</h1>
        
<p>V2.1 is a game update released December 25th, 2022. This update adds many features to the game, such as assets and alliance missions. You can also view the dev's plan for v2.1</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>.  This version has been in testing in the beta site for some time. No world resets were done with the introduction of new features.You can view the code for v2.1</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>New features</h2>
<h3>Assets</h3>
<p>v2.1 will introduce airport assets. They are very expensive buildings that can be built in airports to help you earn money, and also provide boosts to the airport itself, such as extra income, population, charms and increased transit. Each airport will have a unique set of available assets based on many factors (e.g. only cold places can build ski resorts).</p>
<p>Note that RoI (Return on investment) is dependant on base cost. Expensive buildings may have low RoI, but have high total profit compared to cheap buildings.</p>
<p>5 business charm</p>
<p>50k population</p>
<h3>Alliance missions</h3>
<p>v2.1 will also introduce alliance missions. These are challenges that an alliance can attempt together to gain delegates, cash, loyalty or reputation. The game will also show revenue, pax transported, loyalist amount, lounge visit, championed airports and championed countries in the Alliance tab for your own alliance. A table of possible alliance missions is below.</p>
<p>Bold missions</p>
<p>are confirmed to be in v2.1,</p>
<p>underlined missions</p>
<p>are planned but not confirmed to be in v2.1.</p>
<p>Example: Transport 100k weekly pax.</p>
<p>Example: Transport 100k business and first class pax.</p>
<p>Example: Welcome 10k lounge visitors.</p>
<p>Example: Hold 100 airports of size 4 or higher with rank 3 or above.</p>
<p>Example: Hold 10 countries with more than 10mil population with rank 4 or above.</p>
<p>Example: Hold 100 rep.</p>
<p>Example: Hold 1mil loyalists.</p>
<p>Example: Earn 10mil ticket revenue/week alliance-wide.</p>
<h3>New airplanes</h3>
<p>v2.1 may introduce several new airplanes that can transport up to 62 pax for airports with very small (<750m) runways. More info can be found in the</p>
<p>Github pull request</p>
<p>.</p>
<h3>Base specialisations</h3>
<p>v2.1 is expected to include new/more base specialisations for lvl 13, lvl 14 and lvl 15 bases. They haven't been coded into the game yet though.</p>
<p>AC (the dev)</p>
<p>has expressed</p>
<p>that he wants high-tier base specialisations to give general benefits to the whole airport.</p>
<h2>Simulation changes</h2>
<h3>Maintenance cost factor</h3>
<p>How much you pay for maintenance now depends on the type of planes you run. You only pay 0.4x as default, but you add 0.1x for each family and 0.02x for each model you run. Maintenance cost factor is</p>
<p>the same</p>
<p>for all airplanes you run. Maintenance cost is also going to become more expensive in general.</p>
<h3>Supersonic flight buffs</h3>
<p>v2.1 is also expected to buff the attractiveness of supersonic flights for Swift and business/first class pax. Swift pax are willing to pay twice as much compared to v2, and business/first class pax are willing to pay around 15% more for supersonic flights without satisfaction changing.</p>
<h3>Delay/Cancellation compensation changes</h3>
<p>In the developer announcement, AC (the dev) has stated that he will reduce the frequency of delays for old aircraft and will adjust compensation based on office SQ. This hasn't been coded into the game yet.</p>
<h3>Increased discount for unpopular aircraft</h3>
<p>AC has said that he plans to increase the maximum discount for unpopular aircraft up to 50%, doubling it compared to the current maximum discount of 25%. This hasn't been implemented yet</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<h3>Alliance co-leader</h3>
<p>An alliance leader/co-leader can now set other airlines as co-leaders, which allows them to accept new members and kick members out of the alliance, but doesn't allow deleting the alliance or kicking co-leaders/leaders out of the alliance. This has been implemented and added to v2.</p>
<h3>Colouring airlines by alliance</h3>
<p>You can set the text colour of airlines by the alliance they belong to in the alliance tab. Alliance leaders/co-leaders can alter the colour scheme of each alliance for all alliance members, not just for themselves. This has been implemented and added to v2.</p>
