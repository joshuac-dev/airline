<h1>Demand</h1>
<p>Demand is the amount of passengers that want to travel between any two given airports each in-game</p>
<p>week</p>
<p>. Demand randomly fluctuates within a certain range each week and includes travel in both directions. Demand is unique for any two airports and may be as low as zero to as high as ten thousands.</p>
<h2>Route Demand</h2>
<h3>Direct Demand</h3>
<p>The average direct demand is shown when planning a route between two cities. Generally, the higher the</p>
<p>airports'</p>
<p>population coverage on both ends of the route, the more direct demand there will be. In addition, various other factors such as airport</p>
<p>charms</p>
<p>, airport types, income, distance (short/medium/long), flight type (domestic/international) and country relationships influence the demand.</p>
<p>Demand for a random route.</p>
<p>Demand for each</p>
<p>seat</p>
<p>type is listed in the following format: (economy class "Y")/(business class "J")/(first class "F"). The example shown has 6326 economy class, 108 business class, and 0 first class seats in demand. Next to it is the passenger type for the whole route (see below).</p>
<h3>Indirect Demand</h3>
<p>Example of a passenger map.</p>
<p>Indirect demand (sometimes called transfer passengers) occurs when there is not enough flight volume to fulfill all direct demand, so passengers take indirect routes to reach their destination. To illustrate, if there is unfulfilled demand between Airports A and C but routes A&lt;-&gt;B and B&lt;-&gt;C exist, passengers between A and C will try to travel A&lt;-&gt;B and B&lt;-&gt;C. This can result in actual passenger volume surpassing the direct demand of a route many times over, especially between major hubs, as passengers use the route as part of their transit to their ultimate destination. Unlike direct demand, indirect demand is not listed and can only be estimated.</p>
<p>Indirect demand is met by connecting flights and/or shuttles - transfers will prioritize player and player alliance airlines equally, and then non-alliance airlines. The</p>
<p>passenger map</p>
<p>of a route will display indirect demand being fulfilled. Routes from other airlines are in white-gray lines, alliance will be in orange lines, and your routes will be in a purple-pink line.</p>
<p>Note that not all airports allow passengers arriving from a foreign country to take a transfer to another foreign country (international transfers - Sixth Freedom of The Air); only countries with openness &gt;= "Open market" would allow it.</p>
<h4>General Transit</h4>
<p>A new feature that removes shuttles, and lets passengers from nearby airports (within 50km) move between the two locations. There is a limit for each airport, which is 10,000 times the scale of the smallest airport. This span also allows airports that are in different countries that have a relationship of 2 or higher.</p>
<h3>Passenger Types</h3>
<p>Not to be confused with demand types and travel preferences (see below), there are two basic types: business and tourist.</p>
<h4>Business</h4>
<p>Business passengers travel for business purposes. They prefer premium products such as business and first class seats, and airport lounges, especially for longer flights.</p>
<h4>Tourist</h4>
<p>Tourist passengers typically prefer economy seats, and are not bothered by the lack of an airport lounge.</p>
<h3>Other Information</h3>
<p>Demand Stealing is regarded as a problem. Read</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>for more information, it is highly recommended.</p>
<h2>Passenger Preferences</h2>
<p>Each passenger has a travel preference that affects how satisfied they will be on your flight. To check the details on your route,  click the</p>
<p>Survey</p>
<p>button, in the history section. Handy table below:</p>
<p>Three stars has a high priority, two stars are medium priority, and one star is low priority. N/a signifies that this trait does not matter to the passenger.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Pricing
: High prices will drive away this passenger, so if you charge higher prices than the default prices or other competitors, they will complain.
</li>
<li>
Frequency/Stops
: Passengers will prefer to take flights that depart often (~10-14 frequency at least) and don't have stopovers. In some cases, usually with really small airports, a stopover flight will be required from under served airports.
</li>
<li>
Quality
: Mainly related to your route quality and overall service quality. If the route quality does not meet expectations (click on the star icon next to the from/to airport in the route edit screen) and/or your current service quality (in the office) is low, your SF for the route will lower.
</li>
<li>
Loyalty
: This is the most difficult route requirement to satisfy, as it requires you to have the highest amount of loyalty in both airports.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Passenger Types</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Budget
: These are generally going to make up the most of your route. Keep your prices low and you'll be sure to attract them. This kind of pax are more common in low-income countries.
</li>
<li>
Carefree
: They don't exist in-game and aren't generated by the simulation, so you can ignore them.
</li>
<li>
Swift
: They're more likely to complain if you don't offer enough flights per week, and if you make them take multiple stops. More swift pax will show up on your supersonic flights.
</li>
<li>
Comprehensive
: They require a bit of everything, and that includes loyalty.
</li>
<li>
Brand Aware/Conscious
: As long as you keep them satisfied with everything else, you can  bump up the prices on them a little bit.
</li>
<li>
Elite
: High emphasis on quality and loyalty, and are commonly business/first class passengers. They also require a lounge if you want to make the the most happy, and they might require it to be a high enough level.
</li>
</ul>
