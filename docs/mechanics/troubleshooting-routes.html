        <h1>Troubleshooting routes</h1>
        
<p>Your routes may have some problems, here are some tips to help fix them.</p>
<h2>Creating Routes</h2>
<h3>Difficulty</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Add delegates to the destination country to decrease the difficulty. Having a good relation with a country helps in the route creation process.
</li>
<li>
In countries with low openness, making flights from them by airlines having an HQ in another country are difficult (i.e. if an airline based in the US tried to make a route from an airport in Venezuela, which has an openness of 1). It will be highly beneficial to assign delegates to such countries.
<ul>
<li>
The reason above is also why making routes to these countries are difficult.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updating Routes</h2>
<h3>Negotiations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
While it is reassuring to have the 100% success rate, you may want to reduce the delegates to use more on other routes.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Profits</h2>
<h3>Low revenue-to-profit ratio</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Check your costs on the route (which include Fuel Cost, Crew Cost, Airport Fees, Depreciation, etc.). The highest of these will usually be fuel, service supplies, and compensation depending on the route. Fuel can only be lowered by buying
fuel contracts
, service supplies can be lowered by changing the
service quality
, and compensation can be eliminated by keeping a new fleet.
</li>
<li>
Inefficient planes (fuel wise) such as the
Concorde
or the
Tupolev 144D
usually need high prices to offset the fuel cost. Keep this in mind when pricing tickets and finding routes.
</li>
<li>
Longer routes offer higher revenue, but there are higher costs (mostly in fuel). When played right, these long haul (or ultra long haul!) routes can become extremely valuable.
