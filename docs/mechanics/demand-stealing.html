        <h1>Demand Stealing</h1>
        
<p>The practice of demand stealing is considered to be one of the most pressing problems.</p>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p>A $0 flight from a bygone era.</p>
<p>Demand</p>
<p>can be "generated" and "controlled" through ticket prices. Dropping the ticket price generally will increase demand on that route--if the flight is to a big airport, you are likely "stealing" demand from other airlines, meaning their passengers are taking your transfer flight because it's cheaper than the alternative(s). This is also why "demand stealer" accounts with $0 prices were previously so successful at disrupting large markets (now the code has been patched, and $0 tickets are not as favored) since they had created "infinite demand" through an unbelievable low price. The community will generally frown upon using such practices,</p>
<p>and may result in a ban</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If you suspect someone of doing these practices, please report them to a mod by opening a ticket in the #support channel in the discord, or by DM'ing them. Please make sure that the player you are reporting is really doing this practice, as falsely accusing someone may get you a warning.</p>
<p>If you are upset that you are not doing well, do not accuse other players</p>
<p>. Instead, try asking around in the discord or in-game chat for assistance, and there will be multiple people who will be happy to help you.</p>
<h2>Price Wars</h2>
<p>There is a difference between a "demand stealer", and undercutting in price wars. In contested routes, such as many domestic routes within China or routes between major European airports, airlines may choose to set low prices to gain demand. This is especially true with newer airlines, as they don't have the time to increase their average service quality nor the income to do so (the higher SQ you set in the</p>
<p>office</p>
<p>, the more it will cost), but larger airlines will also partake in this practice to upset their competitors. Prices may go so far to charge prices that are half, or a third of the defaulted price.</p>
<p>With larger airlines</p>
<p>[</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>]</p>
<p>, they will undercut to take demand away from the other. This may go to the point where one, or both, are losing money on the route. Smaller airlines will not be able to survive this, due to not having income from other routes. This is one of the ways to spot a demand stealer, an airline only using super-low prices on competitive routes.</p>
