        <h1>Making a route</h1>
        
<p>Here's a guide to making various routes.</p>
<h2>Route Creation</h2>
<p>Plan Route page for LHR-TFS.</p>
<p>To make any route, click on an airport you wish to make the route to, then click on the "</p>
<p>Plan flight</p>
<p>" button. Once loaded, you will see a page to your right, similar to the image on the right.</p>
<h3>In the page</h3>
<p>What's in this page?</p>
<ul>
<li>
Departure/Arrival airports. The gear icon (Next to the departure airport on the right) lets you change the departure airport if you have multiple bases. Select the desired base from the dropdown menu.
</li>
<li>
Flight Code
.
</li>
<li>
Country relationship and Airline Relationship with Destination. The higher (or lower) these values are, the easier (or harder) the negotiation will be.
</li>
<li>
Title with Destination Country.
</li>
<li>
Distance and
Demand
.
</li>
<li>
Direct Competitions. Useful for selecting frequency/price/quality.
</li>
<li>
Setup cost (self explanatory, I hope), Estimated Difficulty, and Available Airplane Model. Estimated difficulty shoes you the difficulty of creating/updating the route. a dash means there is no negotiation needed. Airplane Model opens a dropdown, with airplanes that can be used at the top, then airplanes you don't own with the least costing at the top.
</li>
<li>
Price. Sets ticket price for Economy (Y), Business (J), and First (F) class passengers, from left to right. Editable.
</li>
<li>
Available Airplanes and Flight Frequency. Gives the plane with available flight time. Used planes are blue, and unused planes are gray. use the tick boxes to show the usage (clock) and condition (gear) of every available plane.
</li>
<li>
Capacity, Service Level, and Office staff. Capacity is the total capacity of the route. Service level sets the service level of the planes, 1 star being the lowest possible quality, and 5 being the most.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Route negotiation screen.</p>
<h3>Negotiations</h3>
<p>Once you are satisfied with the settings, you can click create/update. You should then be greeted by the route negotiation screen. This screen gives you the changes to (or addition of) the route. Below, you will see the negotiation difficulty and delegates.</p>
<p>To complete this step, you have to add delegates until you have a chance to succeed. To increase your chances, you can add more delegates. There is a max of 10 delegates that can be used per negotiation. If the button doesn't light up, the negotiation may be too difficult.</p>
<p>Interestingly, negotiations involve the game selecting a randomly generated number and seeing if it's higher than the fail chance percentage</p>
<p>[</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>]</p>
<p>. In other words, it's (RNG)>Chance of failure for a successful route, and RNG can't be higher than 100 or lower than 1.</p>
<h2>First Routes</h2>
<p>While you could theoretically attempt to start off with long-haul international routes, it's easier to start with smaller, more regional routes. First off, longer range planes will typically have large amount of seats that you will have to fill, in order to negate the massive fuel costs. Being a new airline, you may not be able to get enough passengers to fill your routes, as you will not have enough awareness.</p>
