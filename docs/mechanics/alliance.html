<h1>Alliance</h1>
<p>An alliance is a group of airlines that work together to help each other expand their flight network.</p>
<h2>Creating/Joining an Alliance</h2>
<p>You can join existing alliances, or create your own.</p>
<h3>Creating</h3>
<p>Name for a random alliance.</p>
<h3>Joining</h3>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Passengers are more likely to take flights with other alliance members (via code (IATA) sharing), in the form of
transfer passengers
</li>
<li>
Reputation boost, minimum of 5, up to 50 (only applies to alliances with three or more members)
</li>
<li>
Private chat for alliance members (for either planning or talking)
</li>
<li>
Map showing all alliance flight routes (like the rival map).
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alliance Ranking</h2>
<p>Based on the number of</p>
<p>champion points</p>
<p>the alliance has, your alliance will be ranked (where the more points you have, the better). The higher up in the leader board you are, the more reputation you will gain (from the alliance), up to 50 extra points. Like mentioned above, these benefits only apply to "registered" alliances (alliances with 3+ members).</p>
<h2>Alliance Descriptions/Details</h2>
<h3>Oneworld</h3>
<p>Oneworld has been the #1 alliance since the early days of v2, with</p>
<p>CSA Czech Airlines</p>
<p>as its leader, creating the alliance in week 1 of the game. It's current co-leaders consist of ForeverAir, WestPac Airlines, and</p>
<p>American Airlines</p>
<p>(CSA's Alt). Oneworld has a vast majority of the top airlines, although Bumbum has started to catch up. Oneworld is known for their "Oneworld Prices", coming from their notoriously high prices on their routes because of their great network. Oneworld dominates most major airports in high-income countries. They are also famous for having massive planes like the A380 or A350-1000 on lots of routes, and consistently dominating the top 20 routes charts as well as the top 20 lounges chart.</p>
<h3>Ciels du Bumbum</h3>
<p>Bumbum was named one of the founding members, Meow's obsession with the word Bumbum. Originally, the alliance was Paw Pals, but after Vulkan Airlines/Cosmic Airways left, the alliance was reorganized with new members into Onyewowwd, an owo play on the Oneworld name. Later, due to PR concerns, the name was changed to Societe du Bumbum. After that, it was changed a third time, this time to Ciels du Bumbum. Bumbum is one of the most hated alliances due to price wars with other alliances, and includes many top airlines such as American Chicken, Air France KLM, and Billiam Air.</p>
<h3>Sky Team</h3>
<p>Sky Team is most famous for it's leader, AFKLM, among others, including To the Sky Airlines (which is rumored to be his brother, but never confirmed), as well as Odessair and Biliam (who was one of the few airlines that really got ahead after joining mid-game, since he was the discoverer of the sheer amount of 1.5 rep airports in the US). AFKLM is extremely impressive and is at "oneworld-level"; however, it is conflicting HQ with Air Italy which Oneworld is probably keeping as PR since he has a good relationship with dev (and is the maintainer of the AC Discord Verification Bot), as well as possible emotional connetions with other members.</p>
<h3>Latin Team</h3>
<p>Latin Team rised due to the top alliances not giving much focus on the low-income countries, and in particular, the latin american countries as well as Africa. In the early days, Oneworld and Paw Pals (obviously, oneworld won in the end) were fighting for the premium pax in the high income countries, neglecting other low income countries that had high rep. Latin Team also holds the most impressive player, AAA (Africair/Azul/Atlantica), not to be confused with the TripleA alliance, and at its peak, was also the only single player to have 3 airlines in the top20 section by rep. Africair was also one of the two airlines (the other being Pizza Air) to ever beat CSA in rep since the very early stages of the game. Unfourtunately, due to inactivity, AAA went bankrupt/rebuilt, and after that, it has never risen to the same level as before.</p>
<h3>Unisky</h3>
<p>Unisky is the developer's alliance and both of his accounts are in it. Following a period of inactivity, his main acount Air Chocobo went bankrupt, who was the only leader of the alliance, and as a result, disbanded. Unisky is currently reforming so make sure to reach out to dev on discord if you're interested! (updated 9/17/22)</p>
<h3>Golden Sun</h3>
<p>Golden Sun is known for Fly or Die, who can be referred to the "AC Mechanics Guy". He knows just about every detail about AC game mechanics He is famous for his dedication to educating new players, and helping them succeed, even writing a public guide on the AC Wiki</p>
<p>Fly or die's Guide</p>
<p>. Golden Sun also has the most calculators and has the best understanding of AC's mechanics compared to any other alliance likely because of Fly or Die.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>
In V1, high-ranking alliances also increase your max flight frequency (but that was removed, due to there being no need for strict frequency limits).
<ul>
<li>
Reputation boosts were also smaller, from 2 to 20 (considering how championing a small country gave you 1 point at most, this is very small).
