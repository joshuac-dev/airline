<h1>Feature Requests</h1>
<p>This is a catalog of all feature requests that have been made by AC users.</p>
<h2>Rejected Feature Requests</h2>
<h3>Anything the dev is not interested in</h3>
<p>If the dev doesn't like your suggestion, you're out of luck, sadly. To be fair, the developer developed this game single-handily, during his free time. He's very opinionated.</p>
<h4>Adding different route numbers for different flights.</h4>
<p>The dev is simply not interested in this idea.</p>
<h3>Complicated suggestions</h3>
<p>If your suggestion is too complicated and doesn't add much to the game experience and the dev doesn't have the time to implement it, then you're also out of luck.</p>
<h4>Multiple aircraft types on one route</h4>
<p>This is a complicated feature to implement and most people are used to the current system.</p>
<h3>Overpowered suggestions</h3>
<h4>Partnerships with other airlines outside of alliances</h4>
<p>Rejected in the past. Would be too game-breaking, as alliance's transit effect is very powerful.</p>
<h4>Selling shares of airlines</h4>
<p>It'll be easy for the top airlines to transfer money to each other, which can give a massive boost to the benefiting airline. This is unacceptable in Airline Club.</p>
<h3>Realism for the sake of realism</h3>
<p>If the only reason why to add your new feature is to make the game more realistic, then it'll be rejected. Airline Club puts game balance over realism most of the time. In addition, note AC (the developer) is not an AvGeek and more of a simulation-game person.</p>
<h4>Plane crashes</h4>
<p>It wouldn't add much value to the game, as it would only get triggered in very rare situations, and the penalty for flying an old aircraft is already high enough.</p>
<h3>Features that only adds complexity, but nothing else/Micromanagement</h3>
<p>The dev prefers mechanics to be simple, and will reject mechanics that only add complexity. New mechanics should ideally bring a new challenge. It's part of Airline Club's design philosophy.</p>
<h4>New aircraft similar to already-included aircraft</h4>
<p>If the aircraft doesn't fill a particular niche, it won't be added. If it's too similar to an already in-game aircraft, it'll not be added. Examples of rejected aircraft include fuel-efficient but more expensive versions of existing aircraft. However, if the aircraft does fill a particular niche, feel free to suggest it. Example: Short-runway aircraft with relatively high capacity.</p>
<h4>Refurbishing aircraft</h4>
<p>The current system where you pay more to have newer aircraft works perfectly fine and there's simply no need for this.</p>
<h4>Aircraft leasing</h4>
<p>It will add too much micromanaging, it's complex to code, and the dev wants airlines to be airlines, not aircraft leasing companies.</p>
<h4>Premium Economy/Cargo</h4>
<p>A very popular suggestion that lots of people suggest. Dev has rejected it, because there's no need for another generic class. Unique mechanics can be proposed though.</p>
<h4>Special events affecting demand (aside from Olympics)</h4>
<p>The dev doesn't want more time-based events in AC, and prefers a relatively static world.</p>
<h4>Contract routes</h4>
<p>See above.</p>
<h4>Adjusting legroom, charging for bags/check-in, training better staff, R&amp;D , etc.</h4>
<p>Basically just any tiny stuff that makes airlines slightly more/less profitable for a slightly better/worse passenger experience. Dev uses SQ for all of this. That's why office SQ exists.</p>
<h3>World changes (any editing of airport/city/country/airplane data)</h3>
<p>The dev doesn't want to change the Airline Club game world while it is running. He will only implement changes when the game world is reset. The next reset date is unknown.</p>
<p>There's an exception to adding new runways to airports that don't have runway data.</p>
<h3>Increasing game speed/Revamping delegate system</h3>
<p>Airline Club is not meant to be played 24/7. It's more of a game where you log in 3 times a day, do some editing of your airline for 10 minutes then go back to whatever you were doing. This is part of Airline Club's design philosophy.</p>
<h3>Slot system for airports</h3>
<p>In the past, Airline Club used to have a slot system, but this was later superseded by the staff/base system which is less limiting to airline growth. The dev is not interested in going back to the slot system.</p>
