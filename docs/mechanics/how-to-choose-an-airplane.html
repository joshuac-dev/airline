        <h1>How to choose an airplane</h1>
        
<p>Choosing your starting airplanes is critical when beginning an airline and when improving your network. There are 135 different passenger aircraft available in the game. The following are tips and suggestions you may choose to adopt into your gameplay.</p>
<p>When starting out, it is important to consider a few factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Price
</li>
<li>
Capacity
</li>
<li>
Range
</li>
<li>
Fuel burn
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheaper, lower capacity planes can often earn their own cost back quicker. However, they may have limited range, capacity, or high fuel burn.</p>
<p>While higher capacity planes can transport more passengers per flight, they will typically cost more and have a higher fuel burn (intentionally designed this way for "game balance" purposes). This increases their operating cost, potentially lowering profit margins. A good indicator to compare fuel usage between different airplanes is to divide the fuel burn by the capacity. Lower outcomes mean less fuel is used per passenger transported.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>cost per pax mod</p>
<p>is also a good indicator if you want to compare planes with all factors combined (fuel burn/pax, speed (note that fuel burn is calculated by flight time), cost, turnaround time, etc.).</p>
<p>Range varies widely, from 806 km to 17,960 km. Longer range routes typically come with higher ticket prices, but fees cost more due to the higher fuel burn of longer ranged planes.</p>
<p>High amounts of fuel burn can generate lower profits when</p>
<p>oil</p>
<p>prices are high. On the other hand, they can also provide higher fuel profit when oil prices are low. Sometimes, they are necessary to make longer routes or to transport more passengers. Comparing models by finding the fuel and price per passenger (Fuel or price divided by max capacity) is sufficient in most cases.</p>
<p>For airlines that have larger income, larger aircraft are suggested: they can transport more passengers for the same amount of</p>
<p>staff</p>
<p>required to run more flights on a smaller plane model. This lets you make other routes/increase capacity with your free staff.</p>
<p>Before investing in a new airplane model, always check if the airport where you want to use that plane has a runway length that is equals or greater to the minimum runway requirement of the airplane model. Don't forget to check the length of the route, and if your plane can cover it.</p>
