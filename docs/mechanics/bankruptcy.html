<h1>Bankruptcy</h1>
<h2>Bankruptcy</h2>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>Bankruptcy is not an everyday occurrence in Airline Club, but it is a pertinent fear for most airlines.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy has two conditions, all of which must be met in order for it to be triggered.</p>
<p>When these two conditions are met, your airline is bankrupted, and you essentially restart the whole game.</p>
<h3>How to avoid bankruptcy</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, most airlines do not go bankrupt immediately. There are a number of steps you can take to (mostly) avoid it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Analyze your cashflow.
Take loans based on your profits. It's best to take
loans
that require a weekly payment that is less than your weekly profit unless you really, really believe you can make more profit to pay off the weekly payment.
</li>
<li>
Don't make drastic changes.
The pax demand market is incredibly volatile, and it's best to make smaller instead of massive changes to your entire fleet or flights. While this applies to the game in general, this risk is heightened when on a loan.
</li>
</ul>
