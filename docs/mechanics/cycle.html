<h1>Cycle</h1>
<p>A</p>
<p>Cycle</p>
<p>, sometimes referred to as a</p>
<p>Week</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Turn</p>
<p>, is the main unit of time inside the game. All actions done on the game have effect on the simulation only after a new cycle is started. Each cycle is identified by an incremental number.</p>
<p>A picture showing 2 minutes before the start of a new cycle.</p>
<p>The time before a new cycle starts, is shown on the top left corner of the screen.</p>
<h2>Duration</h2>
<p>The duration of each cycle depends on the simulation speed. The current duration is intended to be set to 40 minutes, but that time can increase as more routes and airlines are added to the game world, increasing calculation times on the server</p>
<p>[</p>
<p>notes 1</p>
<p>]</p>
<p>. Due to the amount of airlines, routes, and passengers the game simulates, the timer is aorund 35 minutes, but may vary from that number. There are some witnesses who have seen the in-game timer go up to as high as 52 minutes.</p>
<p>In the legacy game world (v1), the cycle time is around 60 minutes, but it peaked up to 100 minutes in the past. On the other hand, the earliest time was 5 minutes, in early alpha.</p>
<h2>Other units of time</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Month (4 weeks), used for showing route profits in the routes tab and in the office tab
</li>
<li>
Quarter (3 months), larger unit for looking at route profits and in the office tab
</li>
<li>
Year (4 quarters), used for looking in the office tab, and for an aircraft's
lifespan
</li>
<li>
Olympic Cycle (4 years), see
here
for more info
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To find how long something will take, take the amount of weeks, multiply by 35, then divide by 60 to find how many hours in real time will pass during that duration.</p>
<h3>Cheat Sheet</h3>
<p>Here's some real-life time estimations for some timers in airline club.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Failed negotiation delegate cooldown/Route renegotiation cooldown
: ~3 hours 30 min
</li>
<li>
Successful negotiation delegate cooldown
: ~7 hours
</li>
<li>
Loan repayment (52 weeks)
: ~1 day, 6 hours,, 20 minutes
</li>
<li>
Loan repayment (208 weeks)/Olympic cycle
: ~5 days, 1 hour, 20 minutes
</li>
</ul>
