</ul>
<h2>2019</h2>
<ul>
<li>
March 11th
- V2 development starts. Initial ideas include adding a plane cost to a route creation (if there is no plane available), the negotiation system (instead of slots), and LF requirements (i.e. your route has to have reliable LF or it will be deleted by the game).
<p>Negotiations as they looked in 2019.</p>
</li>

Easier to attract business and first class passengers as their quality expectation is lowered
</li>
<li>
Passengers are slightly less willing to downgrade to a different class
</li>
<li>
Passengers are less willing to switch airlines for transits (Removed later that day, due to the amount of transit pax lost)
</li>
<li>
High flight frequency (> 14 per week) will be more attractive to passenger with preference "Swift"
</li>
<li>
Business and First class passengers are less sensitive to price changes
</li>
<li>
Code optimization to avoid some redundant calculations
</li>
<li>
Business and First class passenger favors direct flights more

</li>
<li>
Restrict 5 customizable seat configurations per airplane model - the configuration is customizable and specific to each player.

</li>
<li>
Airplanes will be assigned to a home base, and it can only fly routes from that home base. If a base is removed, then the airplanes will be sent to the HQs
</li>
<li>
Airplanes can switch home base
</li>
<li>
There will be a soft limit on how many routes can a base support (Not implemented yet)
