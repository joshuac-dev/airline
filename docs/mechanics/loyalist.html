        <h1>Loyalist</h1>
        
<p>Loyalists</p>
<p>are a a part of the game that is essential to progressing.</p>
<h2>Gaining Loyalists</h2>
<p>To gain loyalists, flying to airports are really the best way to start collecting them. You can also gain them at an increased rate with higher satisfaction factor (SF) on your routes.</p>
<h2>Airports</h2>
<p>You can find your loyalists in an airport by clicking on an airport or by going to office and finding championed airports on the right (only for airports that you have the top ten loyalists in).</p>
<h3>Champion Points</h3>
<p>Once you have enough loyalists, you can start earning champion points. Typically, smaller airports offer less champion points for the same amount of loyalists in larger airports. However, larger airports will have higher competition (such as JFK, LHR, CDG, and HND), making it harder to maintain your points.</p>
<h3>Airline Grade</h3>
<p>As your reputation improves, you get access to more bases and airplane models. The table below gives the requirements and benefits of each tier.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing, only CSA Czech Airlines has achieved the "Mythic Airline" title, and Vulkan Airlines and American Airlines are the only other airlines above 500 rep.</p>
<h2>Championed Countries</h2>
<p>China's National, Partnered, and Top airlines as of July 18, 2021</p>
<p>An airline's championed countries can be viewed in the office tab. A country will show up in the championed countries area if that airline is top 10 in terms of passengers carried in routes per week, including both domestic and international routes originating or arriving in that specific country. One's market share in a country, which in turn determines their rank, also determines their relationship with a country. By reaching one of the top airlines in the country in terms of passengers carried, one can get a loyalty bonus, which allows for huge loyalist (and therefore, reputation gains through championed airports) to even airports that the airline has never flown to. National Airlines give the most loyalty bonus, and can have multiple slots, up to 2 at the time of this writing. Partnered airlines are below the national airline, and give a less loyalty bonus than national airlines do. At the time of this writing, there can be up to 3 partnered airlines depending on the population of the country.</p>
