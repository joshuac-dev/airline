<h1>Profit Question &amp; Answers.</h1>
<p>THIS PAGE IS CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS.</p>
<p>Although I've been playing Airline Club for 4 months (at time of writing), I still find it a slow progress to get the airlines profit to climb steadily. There are many aspects to making your airline profitable. HQ's, bases, aircraft, establishing routes, fuel, services all cost money. Then there is the costs, HQ/base upkeep, service investment, depreciation &amp; other expenses &amp; loan repayments (if you have a loan). We all want to make a profit as without making a profit, you can't expand your airline, which is what Airline Club is all about. It's a fine balance to get it right &amp; very easy to get wrong. Starting out &amp; early game can make all the difference, it's best to go slow &amp; steady, don't get over enthusiastic &amp; build too many bases, these suck up money fast. Don't go buying big aircraft 150 PAX + or more (like Boeing or Airbus aircraft), you are better starting off with Bombardier or Embraer aircraft, which are a cheaper investment initially &amp; low fuel cost.

<p>. So how do you keep your airline in the black on your spread sheet &amp; a few other questions?  Here's some questions that I think might help to make it easier for you to keep your airline on track &amp; answered by one of Airline Clubs very successful Airline CEO's, whom I thank very much for his input.</p>
<p>We'll assume you have started an airline, established your HQ, used your 1st five free, 5 Freq flights &amp; have managed to have 100% L/F (load factor) on those flights.</p>
<p>Do's:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Think carefully, have a plan in mind as to where you want to establish routes &amp; bases.
</li>
<li>
Choose aircraft that will be sufficient (enough range/economical &amp; capacity) for the route's you are planning.
</li>
<li>
Research. Look at who is flying on a proposed route, what the freq's are, capacity they are carrying, ticket pricing, assets they may have &amp; use the research tab &amp; check demand.
</li>
<li>
Use a slow &amp; steady approach to expanding your airline, things can go badly very quickly when you make a mistake.
</li>
<li>
Want to expand a base, new big shiny aircraft? Think you could use a bank loan? Check your income/cash flow &amp; make sure you can afford the repayments &amp; don't forget the added cost of whatever it is you are taking the loan out for.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Get carried away building bases, they will seriously impact your profit before you are making enough money to cover the cost.
</li>
<li>
Get excited by shiny large aircraft eg: Boeing, Airbus with 150+ PAX while trying to establish new routes
(note this could be different establishing an long haul international route).
</li>
<li>
Open a route &amp; offer a extremely low price compared with competitors on the same route. It will be frowned upon by the Airline Club community &amp; you may find the big established airlines will be able to offer an even lower price (they can easily afford a loss), which will make things very difficult for you to re-establish the route at all.
</li>
<li>
Avoid large loans or in-fact any loans when you are starting out if possible.
</li>
</ul>
