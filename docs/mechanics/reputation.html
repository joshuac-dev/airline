        <h1>Reputation</h1>
        
<p>Reputation (shortened form: rep) in considered to be one of the most essential units to progressing in the game. Reputation determines the amount of</p>
<p>delegates</p>
<p>you can use, and is the main factor in measuring the size of airlines in-game</p>
<h2>What is Reputation?</h2>
<p>Reputation is a number that the game uses for various reason, such as a ranking in the</p>
<p>rivals</p>
<p>menu, or for determining delegate count. Your current reputation (In stars) is shown next to your airline's name. Hover over the stars to see your reputation number.</p>
<p>For a full breakdown on your reputation points, you can check the</p>
<p>office</p>
<p>menu. It shows you your future reputation as well there. When you gain reputation points, you do not immediately get them added; they slowly increase to the total number (hence the future and current distinguishers),</p>
<h3>Airline Grade</h3>
<p>Your airline grade is determined by your the reputation you have. The higher your reputation, the more you unlock. See the table below for reference.</p>
<h3>Delegates</h3>
<p>To determine your delegate number, use the following function</p>
<p>[</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>]</p>
<p>:</p>
<p>In which, BASE_DELEGATE_COUNT is 5 and DELEGATE_PER_LEVEL is 3. The game is only coded to give up to 56 delegates, but that is extremely unfeasible, as getting and securing that many reputation points is considered to be impossible with all the players currently in-game.</p>
<h2>Earning Reputation Points</h2>
<p>There are two kinds of reputation points: fixed and temporary.</p>
<p>Fixed reputation are points that will stay with you indefinitely until you lose them, such as alliance points, championed airport points, and points gained by transporting passengers. Almost all airlines earn all of their reputation through these points.</p>
<p>Temporary reputation are points that will go away at some point, and usually are</p>
<p>rewards</p>
<p>from events. Temporary reputation points are notorious for decaying quickly.</p>
<h3>Championing Airports</h3>
<p>This is the main way to earn champion points, by getting the most</p>
<p>loyalists</p>
<p>at any given airport. Generally, large, gateway airports give the most reputation (e.g. JFK, LHR, SIN), but are the most crowded (as the game has been out for some time and the older airlines have tight control over them).</p>
<p>All airports have some amount of reputation points you must earn to get all of the points. To find the current amount. take the decimal of your loyalists to the covered population, and multiply it by the total reputation points (i.e. if I have a ratio of 0.25 of an airport with 20 reputation points, I would get around 5 points).</p>
<h3>Transporting passengers.</h3>
<p>This is a very easy way to earn more reputation as a small airline. The more passengers you transport, the more reputation you get. However, the amount of reputation you can get from transporting passengers is capped at 100, making this method unusable mid-game. Due to the low difficulty of obtaining rep through this way, almost all airlines have at least 100 reputation.</p>
