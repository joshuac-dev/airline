<h2>Campaigns</h2>
<p>Starting a campaign at LHR.</p>
<p>Campaigns can be a strategic tool to help an airline achieve a goal in an airport. They do have a weekly cost, which increases with the number of assigned delegates.</p>
<p>For information about active campaigns, look under Airplane Livery. This shows a quick list of your active campaigns. Clicking on the gear icon next to the title opens a more detailed list of active campaigns, showing not only the area (location) and population coverage, but also the radius (size) of the campaign, level, and the number of airports that is covered. Clicking on a row brings you to the campaign edit screen, allowing you to add or remove delegates, increase or decrease the radius, or delete the campaign entirely.</p>
<p>To create a campaign, press the</p>
<p>plus button next to "Active Campaigns" in the detailed campaign menu. You will be prompted to enter in a city or airport. Entering a city brings up airports that are within the city and airport lets you choose the specific airport. The airport you select is the center of the campaign. From there, you can adjust the radius and the number of delegates you assign.</p>
<p>Each level of a delegate is multiplied by the awareness and loyalty boost the campaign gives per level (e.g. 3 level 2 delegates on a campaign giving 5 awareness pre level gives 30 awareness). Increasing the radius decreases the loyalty and awareness per level. When removing delegates, they are deleted in order recent addition (newer assigned delegates will be removed first before higher level delegates are removed). When adding more delegates, the weekly cost will increase by the cost of one delegate per week times the number of delegates assigned to the campaign.</p>
<p>The amount of awareness and loyalty that is given per delegate depends on the population that is encompassed in the campaign. The higher the total population, the less awareness and loyalty that will be given from each delegate.</p>
