<h1>Airline Profile</h1>
<p>When choosing the starting airport after creating your airline for the first time, or starting over via declaring bankruptcy, you have the option to select between three</p>
<p>Airline Profiles</p>
<p>(alternately called a start).</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>Airline Profiles for LHR when difficult is 0. (Taken on June 6th, 2021)</p>
<p>The available options vary in difficulty, but the harder the start is, the more capital you will start with. All loans from profiles have 10% interest</p>
<h3>Entrepreneurial Spirit</h3>
<p>This start is considered to be easy, and is highly recommended for beginners to help them get a feel for the game. You start with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
1 times the airport's base capital (In cash)
</li>
<li>
0 Awareness
</li>
<li>
0 Reputation
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the problems with this start is the lack of starting reputation and awareness which may cause low or very inconsistent load factors.</p>
<h3>A Humble Beginning</h3>
<p>Managing a loan is introduced in this start, with a medium sized loan (and interest) to begin with. You receive a small multiplier towards your starting capital. The total package includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
1.5 times the airport's base capital
</li>
<li>
Some amount of planes under the
small
category, each at 90% condition
</li>
<li>
20 Awareness
</li>
<li>
10 Reputation
</li>
<li>
Loan as big as the airport's base capital
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Revival of past glory</h3>
<p>This start is considered by most players to be the hardest start, as low competition and high demand are needed for this start to work. However, the rewards from doing this start correctly allow you to grow faster than other airlines. The airline you take over will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
4 times the airport's base capital
</li>
<li>
Some
large
planes, each at 70% condition
</li>
<li>
50 awareness
</li>
<li>
25 reputation
</li>
<li>
Loan 3.5 times the airport's base capital
</li>
</ul>
