<h1>Oil</h1>
<p>Oil</p>
<p>(alternately called fuel) is a cost when a flight takes place. The price fluctuates through a random number generator.</p>
<p>The average price for fuel is considered to be $70 price per barrel (ppb).</p>
<h2>Oil Menu</h2>
<p>The oil menu can be accessed by clicking on the oil icon.</p>
<p>Oil menu. Prices are relatively stable.</p>
<h3>Fuel Consumption History</h3>
<p>The fuel consumption history shows how much fuel your airline used in the last</p>
<p>cycle</p>
<p>, giving you a rough idea of how many barrels you should buy with an oil contract.</p>
<h3>Inventory Policies</h3>
<p>Inventory policies are a way to ensure a less volatile price for oil, there are 4 types of policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Conservative - shields from 90% of price fluctuation (default option)
</li>
<li>
Balanced - shields from 50% of price fluctuation
</li>
<li>
Aggressive - shields from 20% of price fluctuation
</li>
<li>
No Inventory - current market price
</li>
</ul>
<p>Clicking on the gear icon next to the current policy gives you the different options as well as the new price. The inventory policy can only be changed once every 50 weeks. Choosing high shield percentages can help when fuel prices suddenly spike, they may backfire when there's low prices.</p>
<h3>Oil Contracts</h3>
<p>Oil contracts lock the price of oil in at the market price you brought the contract in. While you still have to pay for oil, you can potentially get it at a lower price even if the current price is higher. This is particularly useful and can reduce costs during times when prices are high.</p>
<p>If you need more oil than what your contract can provide, additional barrels will be bought using the active inventory policy; at the same time, if you use less oil than what your contract provides, it will be sold at half the current market price.  It is possible to sell fuel for a profit if timing allows.</p>
<p>A contract lets you buy up to 1.2 times your current fuel consumption, for up to 200 weeks. The initial cost 3(barrels*weeks of contract).Termination fees are 5(barrel*weeks of contract) A 20 week long contract of 1,000 barrels would initially cost $60,000, and have a termination cost of $100,000.</p>
<p>You can have up to 5 active contracts at the same time. If you want to terminate a contract early, you have to pay a termination fee, as well as the initial cost.</p>
