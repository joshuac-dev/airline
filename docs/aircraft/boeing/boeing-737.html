<p>The Boeing 737 is the second most delivered aircraft, and the most delivered aircraft that is still in production. The game has three families instead of the four that has been created.</p>
<h2>Boeing 737 Original</h2>
<h3>In-Game</h3>
<p>The -100 has the most orders (over 350!), due to an ongoing joke of the -100 being the best plane. The other models in this family pale in comparison. Even if the others were combined, they would not be able to match the planes in circulation as the -100 has.</p>
<h3>Specs</h3>
<h3>Trivia</h3>
<ul>
<li>
NASA took the prototype of the 737-100 for testing and training for astronauts. It was designated NASA 515.
</li>
<li>
The -300, -400, -500, and -600 were based on the design of the -100/-200.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Boeing 737 Next Generation</h2>
<p>Sometimes abbreviated as NG, the Next Generation has the most amount of aircraft in the 737 families.</p>
<h3>In-Game</h3>
<p>The -700C is the most ordered aircraft at 290+ units in circulation. All other units have at least 100 units, with the exception of the -600 (85+ units).</p>
<h3>Specs</h3>
<h3>Trivia</h3>
<ul>
<li>
In real-life, the -800 and the -700 are the most popular models and make up most of the orders in the NG family. In-game on the other hand, the -700C is the most popular due to it's fuel efficiency (fuel-to-pax ratio).
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Boeing 737 MAX</h2>
<p>The MAX is the newest generation of the 737, first in service in May of 2017. It may be recognizable due to its mass grounding back in March of 2019.</p>
<h3>In-Game</h3>
<p>The MAX 10 has some of the largest amount of planes in circulation in the family and the entire game, at over 1,300 units. The next largest is the MAX 9 at 330+ units, then the MAX 7 at 270+ units, and then MAX 8 at 150+ units.</p>
<h3>Specs</h3>
<h3>Trivia</h3>
<ul>
<li>
The MAX 7, 8, and 9 are based on the -700, -800, and -900 respectively. The MAX 10 is a stretched version of the MAX 9.
</li>
<li>
A variant of the MAX 8 called the 8-200 was intended to seat 200 passengers and was certified in March of 2021.
