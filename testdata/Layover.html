<h1>Layover</h1>
<hr>
<div class="mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A layover is when a passenger takes a flight, then takes another flight after they arrive to get to their destination. Passengers generally do this because there's no direct flight to where they want to go. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Costs">Costs</span></h2>
<p>There are hidden costs that passengers pay when taking a transit flight. 
</p><p>First, an extra <b>$100</b> is added to the price for normal connections, reduced to <b>$25</b> for switching between alliance members and yourself. This is part of what makes alliances so strong. 
</p><p>Next, an additional time cost is imposed on connections where neither of the flights have <b>more than 42</b> frequency, equal to <b>420 / frequency of the more frequent flight</b>.
</p><p>For example, say someone from Xuzhou wants to go to Oslo for some weird reason, and decides to take a (now unavailable) Xuzhou -&gt; Stockholm -&gt; Oslo flight on Golden Sun. (This example is old)
</p><p>Xuzhou -&gt; Stockholm costs <b>$1000</b> on Fly or die, and Stockholm -&gt; Oslo costs <b>$150</b> on Tropic Direct, making it a total of <b>$1150</b>.
</p><p>First, we add the <b>$25</b> fee between alliance members.
</p><p>Next, we add the additional time cost. The larger flight has 35 frequency, while the smaller one only has 1 frequency, but we only count the larger flight.
</p><p><code>420 / 35 = $12</code>
</p><p>So the total cost that passengers see is
</p><p><code>$1000 + $150 + $25 + $12 = $1187</code>
</p><p>Now another example. Let's say this Xuzhou guy wants to fly on top quality service from Union Airlines on the Stockholm -&gt; Oslo leg. The <b>$100</b> penalty for transiting, the <b>$180</b> that Union Airlines charges for its tickets, and the <b>$20</b> time cost means it'll cost 
</p><p><code>$1000 + $180 + $100 + $20 = $1300</code>
</p><p>Costs a whole <b>$113 more</b> from the perspective of the passenger when the price difference is only **$30**.
</p><p>**Exceptions to the formula:**
</p><p>Budget pax see added connection cost as only <b>half</b> the actual added cost, Swift pax see it as <b>2x</b> the actual added cost. For example, if transiting to a new alliance, which usually costs an <b>extra $100</b>, Budget pax will add on only <b>$50</b> while Swift pax will add on <b>$200</b>.
