<p>Airline Club is an airline simulator that lets you manage an airline. Airline Club is kinda hard, harder than most other airline simulators. Going bankrupt isn’t that rare, even top players sometimes do so, Don’t worry, you aren’t the only one. This guide was made by me in order to help players play the game. (My airline is named Fly or die, hence the title)  
</p><p>It is recommended that you check all the <a href="/wiki/Menus" title="Menus">Menus</a> in the left sidebar to get a feel of what AC is like.  
</p><p>This guide is over a year old and I haven't looked at it since, so if there's something wrong here, please ping me on Discord (username bohaska)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Selecting_a_location">Selecting a location</span></h2>
<p>There are 3 main factors that determine whether a location is good, mainly reputation (REP), demand, and competition. I recommend selecting a low competition area with plenty of demand. Since the game doesn't simulate inequality very well, budget airlines in high-income countries (like the USA) don't work. It's not recommended to start in an airport with lots of competition.  
</p><p>The optimal strategy for this game is to go to a place with high demand, good domestic network but weak international network, then fly lots of long-range international/intercontinental routes out of it to earn money. After earning at least 5 billion, relocate/rebuild to a competitive area and try to gain rep. However, this method may be boring.

</p><h4><span id="TL.3BDR"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="TL;DR">TL;DR</span></h4>
<p>Pick a medium-sized airport with low competition. Check the airport stats on the top-left corner of the airport menu. 
</p><p>For making the most money, I recommend starting in China or India. They have lots of unfulfilled demand that big airlines haven't taken. 
</p>
<h4><span id="Reputation_.2B_Demand"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Reputation_+_Demand">Reputation + Demand</span></h4>
<p>Areas with high average income and big airports in general. Examples include the USA, Europe and Japan. It is highly recommended <b>not</b> to start in these airports, as big airlines can easily destroy smaller airlines there. The advised strategy for airlines wishing to grow to these areas is to start in a Demand + Low competition or Demand area, earn money, and then rebuild your airline later, moving you base to bigger, more competitive airport. The recommended rebuild value for these types of places is at least 5 billion.
</p>
<h4><span id="Demand_.2B_Low_competition"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Demand_+_Low_competition">Demand + Low competition</span></h4>
<p><s>Underserved destinations in general. Examples include South America. These types of destinations are good for new airlines to start in, as they can earn lots of money and grow very quick. However, the lack of reputation may lead to stagnation later game.</s> I no longer recommend South America as a place to start in. Demand is not very high and runways are short.  
</p><p>The optimal strategy is to base in one of these airports, then spam long-range flights from them to earn money. To deal with this region's low rep and high competition, it's best to relocate somewhere else with high amounts of REP (reputation). 
</p>
<h4><span id="Reputation_.28REP.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Reputation_(REP)"><a href="/wiki/Reputation" title="Reputation">Reputation</a> (REP)</span></h4>
<p>Small gateway airports and Africa. Due to gateway airports having a boost to rep, and the game having lots of small territories listed as countries, there are lots of gateway airports in the Pacific and Atlantic islands. Africa, although lacking demand and having strong competition, also has lots of gateway airports. Africa is especially hard due to the lack of countries which allow international-international transfers.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Demand"><a href="/wiki/Demand" title="Demand">Demand</a></span></h4>
<p>Places with high amounts of people but low average income. Includes China, India etc. Although these places have high amounts of demand, they also face lots of competition and do not give as much rep as richer countries due to game design reasons. A large majority of successful airlines in these places are budget airlines. 
</p><p>The optimal strategy is to base in one of these airports, then spam long-range flights from them to earn money. To deal with this region's low rep and high competition, it's best to relocate somewhere else with high amounts of rep after earning a couple of billion dollars, which you will see in the Office &amp; at bottom right of screen "Rebuild Airline". 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Low_competition">Low competition</span></h4>
<p>Small airports in general. Suck in almost all aspects, but don't have much competition. It is possible to turn a low-demand airport with a sufficiently long runway into a high-traffic airport due to <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#Indirect_demand">indirect demand</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Important_notes">Important notes</span></h3>
<p>When you start off, it is normal to lose money. Don't fret. If your flights don't reach full capacity, just wait a few hours or even a day. You have to wait for awareness to build up in your HQ before passengers start using your airline.
</p><p>
If you start in a high-income country and try to compete against another airline, you might find yourself losing even though you provide better service at a cheaper price. This is normal. Due to the fact that the other airline has more loyalty than you, other passengers prefer the other airline more than your airline.</p><figure class="thumb  show-info-icon" typeof="mw:File/Thumb" style="width: 180px"> 	<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/airline-club/images/4/43/Screen_Shot_2021-09-15_at_8.48.49_AM.png/revision/latest?cb=20210915005605" class="mw-file-description image"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-15 at 8.48.49 AM" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/airline-club/images/4/43/Screen_Shot_2021-09-15_at_8.48.49_AM.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20210915005605" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="180" height="99" class="thumbimage" data-image-name="Screen Shot 2021-09-15 at 8.48.49 AM.png" data-image-key="Screen_Shot_2021-09-15_at_8.48.49_AM.png" data-relevant="1" /></a> 	 	<figcaption class="thumbcaption"> 		 			<a href="/wiki/File:Screen_Shot_2021-09-15_at_8.48.49_AM.png" class="info-icon"><svg><use xlink:href="#wds-icons-info-small"></use></svg></a> 		 		 		 			<p class="caption">Where to set service quality, aircraft replacement and campaigns</p> 		 	</figcaption> </figure><p>Please do the following steps in the order I have put them.
</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Set_some_important_things_in_the_Office_tab">Set some important things in the Office tab</span></h3>
<p>In the Office tab, set service quality (20 service quality = 1 star) and Auto Airplane Replacement. To reduce initial costs, increase service quality by 10 around every 12 hours until you reach your desired amount of service. It's best to use low service quality, lower than 50 is good and will save you lots of money. I suggest using 35. For new airlines, I recommend you set airplane replacement at 50%.

<p>For a small airline, I recommend that you start off with using either Embraer planes or Bombardier planes, especially the Bombardier DHC-8-200 and Embraer EMB120. All of the Embraer planes and Bombardier planes are good planes in general. Embraers are cheaper, have better range and help you expand faster, but Bombardier's are more fuel efficient and are a better choice in the long term. Pick the planes that suit your airline (e.g. do not buy 100 seat planes for routes with low demand).
</p><p>To sort airlines by family, select the tab that says Family on the top within the Airplane page.

<p>You start the game with a level 1 HQ. Although this is obviously better than nothing, you will be severely limited if you don't upgrade your base. Level 1 HQ's only allow you to make flights with 5 frequency (Freq) (its a soft cap, not a hard cap). Adding more frequency will drastically increase the amount of delegates required to negotiate. a route.
</p><p>To level up your HQ, you will first need to assign a <a href="/wiki/Delegates" title="Delegates">delegate</a> to the country that the HQ is based in. To do so, click the country button on the left side, search the list using Ctrl-F (Cmd-F for Macs), and enter the name of the country you are based in. When you select a country, a country relationship management panel will appear. Add a delegate using the plus button and confirm your decision.
</p><p>The next step is to actually level up your HQ. Select your HQ on the world map and select the "upgrade" button. Each upgrade will cost you more in base upkeep, so factor that cost within your current  income.

<h3><span id="Create_a_campaign_.5BOPTIONAL.5D"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Create_a_campaign_[OPTIONAL]">Create a campaign [OPTIONAL]</span></h3>
<p>If you still have some remaining delegates and you would like them to be put to work, you can use campaigns! In the office menu, look at the right side and scroll down (or use Ctrl-F) until you find something that says "Campaigns" (under airplane livery on the right side of screen). Add a campaign with 1 delegate and leave the radius of the campaign unchanged. The strength of a campaign varies depending on the amount of people in range, so a campaign in a small town will be stronger than a campaign in New York.  
</p><p>Because of that, campaigns may not work very well if you are based in a big city (small airports close to big airports count, such as LCY or ORY). For these cities, don't make a campaign in the airport you are based in, make a campaign in a nearby small airport. For example, a campaign in Dusseldorf (DUS) with 100km radius will cover 14 million people, well over the 7 million people in Dusseldorf, therefore wasting delegates on improving loyalty in places where you do not need to do so. In comparison, a campaign in Weeze Airport (NRN), a nearby regional airport, will only cover itself (which adds a negligible amount of population) and Dusseldorf, saving you lots of delegates.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Operate_some_intercontinental_routes">Operate some intercontinental routes</span></h5>
<p>Intercontinental routes (or IC routes) have less competition, and earn a lot more money. Don't be fooled by direct demand, as IC's usually have a lot more demand than what is shown on the airport screen (view airport). However, the planes required to make an IC route are very expensive. IC flights also use a lot of staff, so don't make too many of these flights. It is better to increase capacity on existing IC routes.
</p><p>It's best to try to run as many long range flights as you can, as they are great for earning money &amp; also possibly using your domestic flights.  
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Buy_bigger_planes">Buy bigger planes</span></h4>
<p>When your flights start to get too small for the traffic you are carrying, try buying a bigger plane instead of using more frequency on smaller planes.

</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Build_a_base">Build a base</span></h4>
<p>When your HQ is level 3-5 (you decide when to start), it is recommended to build a base in a new airport. Assign a delegate to the country, go to the airport you want to build a base in world map/airport/view airport &amp; Build Base button. Bases are not as powerful as HQ's.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Expand_into_a_big_airport">Expand into a big airport</span></h3>
<p>Lack of reputation may doom your airline mid-game, so after opening 1 or 2 bases, you should expand to a big airport. Big airports provide more rep than smaller airports. Gateway airports are especially prized, as they get a reputation gain bonus for being a gateway airport. (Gateway Airports are where international flights enter &amp; exit a country). 
</p><p>The amount of reputation you gain in an airport is determined by how many loyalists you have, how big the airport is, average income of the cities around the airport, whether the airport is a gateway and the charms the airport has.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Add_business_seats">Add business seats</span></h3>
<p>When your airline is small and your quality is low, its very hard to attract business pax (passengers) to your airline. However, when your airline expands and dominates airports, you can more reliably attract business class passengers. Business class passengers tend to be Elite passengers, with a few Swift pax, so in order to attract lots of them, you'll have to have a lounge and provide good service, but if your flight has high frequency, then you can add a few business seats. Business class tends to earn more than economy.
</p><p>To add business class seats, select the model of the planes that you want to change in the aircraft tab, and then click Config. If you want to edit all planes, change the above configuration (the all economy one). However, if you only want a few planes to have business (biz) pax, make a new configuration. After making it, go to the planes that you want to change, and switch the configuration.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Lounges">Lounges</span></h4>
<p>Lounges are helpful for attracting business pax, as they reduce the perceived price that your business pax see. Each business pax has a required level of lounge from 1 to 3, and more picky biz pax require higher lounges to attract. Lounges are only effective up to the biz pax's required level (a level 2 lounge is only slightly better for a biz pax with an expectation of level 1 lounges), so higher level lounges will affect less biz pax. You will need the base to be scale 3 to build a lounge. 
</p><p>Lounges are useless for economy pax.

<p>From the above table, you can see that a level 1 lounge is the same as dropping prices at least 10% on all of your business class seats! (The effect is actually slightly higher due to biz pax's insensitivity to price). Level 3 lounges on both ends of a long route can reduce the perceived price of a biz seat by 50% for picky biz pax, so if you're flying many biz pax, a lounge will be worth it. However, they can cost a lot, costing a few hundred thousand dollars to run depending on the income level of the airport you are in, so be careful.
</p><p>Lounges will be useless if either departure or destination airport is scale 3 or less.

<p>Not the same as declaring bankruptcy. Don't declare bankruptcy unless you want to reset your account &amp; start all over again.
</p><p>When you rebuild your airline, all of your airplanes and bases will be converted to cash, but loyalists and reputation would not be changed. This is great for moving your airline to a new airport &amp; starting with more cash in some cases. Check the "Balance reset to ....."

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Why_you_might_want_to_rebuild">Why you might want to rebuild</span></h4>
<p>Rebuilding your airline is the only way to move your HQ. HQ's based in a big city are very powerful, and can help you gain rep quickly in said airport. 
</p><p>If you started in a place without lots of rep, you may want to go to another country. Due to your huge amount of cash, you will usually grow quicker than other airlines and more easily champion airports.
</p><p>Rebuilding your domestic airline and converting it into an international/intercontinental airline is a potentially lucrative strategy.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Indirect_demand">Indirect demand</span></h3>
<p>Airline Club's pax simulation is far better than many other airline simulators. Passengers can take and transfer to multiple flights in order to get to their destination, unlike some other airline simulators which only simulate direct demand. Because of this, a small airport can have a lot of passengers (Not the same as having a lot of demand). For example, if someone from London wants to get to Sydney, but there are no direct flights, then the passenger can go via another airport, such as Dubai. If a small airport has a lot of flights to under served destinations, then pax from other airports may go through the small airport to the under served destination. 
</p><p>The possibility of indirect demand is greatly reduced when the country the airport is in has an openness &lt; 7, because these countries do not allow pax to go to 2 different countries via said airport (e.g. London to Sydney via Mumbai is impossible, since India has an openness of 4). However, this does not affect international to domestic transfers (e.g. London to Mumbai via New Delhi), which means that larger countries are less affected since they still have a large amount of domestic demand.
</p><p>The best example of such an airport is Kigali (KGL), Rwanda.
