<h1>Profit Question & Answers.</h1>

</p><p>Although I've been playing Airline Club for 4 months (at time of writing), I still find it a slow progress to get the airlines profit to climb steadily. There are many aspects to making your airline profitable. HQ's, bases, aircraft, establishing routes, fuel, services all cost money. Then there is the costs, HQ/base upkeep, service investment, depreciation &amp; other expenses &amp; loan repayments (if you have a loan). We all want to make a profit as without making a profit, you can't expand your airline, which is what Airline Club is all about. It's a fine balance to get it right &amp; very easy to get wrong. Starting out &amp; early game can make all the difference, it's best to go slow &amp; steady, don't get over enthusiastic &amp; build too many bases, these suck up money fast. Don't go buying big aircraft 150 PAX + or more (like Boeing or Airbus aircraft), you are better starting off with Bombardier or Embraer aircraft, which are a cheaper investment initially &amp; low fuel cost. Read <a href="/wiki/Fly_or_die%27s_Guide" title="Fly or die&#39;s Guide">Fly or die's Guide</a> for the best way to get started &amp; expand &amp; <a href="/wiki/Airline_Club_A-Z_Manual" title="Airline Club A-Z Manual">Airline Club A-Z Manual</a>. So how do you keep your airline in the black on your spread sheet &amp; a few other questions?  Here's some questions that I think might help to make it easier for you to keep your airline on track &amp; answered by one of Airline Clubs very successful Airline CEO's, whom I thank very much for his input.
</p><p>We'll assume you have started an airline, established your HQ, used your 1st five free, 5 Freq flights &amp; have managed to have 100% L/F (load factor) on those flights.
</p>
<ol><li>Is there a minimum profit I should be making on a route?</li>
<li>I have a 100% L/F on a two different routes, but PAX say on the survey "Ticket is too expensive". On one route by 5% &amp; 20% on the other. Should I drop the ticket prices on both routes?</li>
<li>What should I do if PAX survey says "Ticket is too expensive" but I am making little or loosing money on the route?</li>
<li>Why is it, after I have ticket prices set &amp; all is going well for a number of cycles (game weeks), then the next time I check I need to re-adjust them again?</li>
<li>How much should I drop my ticket price, when the survey says "Ticket is too expensive"?</li>
<li>A competitor has started on a route I had that was well established, but the competitors ticket price is a lot lower than mine the other airlines on the same route, what should a try to do?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between SQ (service quality) in the office &amp; star ratings on a route?</li>
<li>What methods can I use to maintain L/F &amp; remain making a profit?</li>
<li>I have a route that that I am constantly having to drop prices, it is still profitable. What could be the cause? What should I do?</li>
<li>Can a competitors route from a airport close to where I am operating from &amp; the destination airport is the same, affect my route?</li>
<li>Is the benefit of airport loyalists/rep worth, making a minimal or a small loss on a route, with no or minimal competitors?</li>
<li>When should I increase freq on a route?</li>
<li>I can't afford a lounge for my airport, is it still beneficial to add business class seats to routes that have demand for business class?</li>
<li>When should I try to add a lounge to a base?</li>
<li>At what point should I add 1st class seats?</li>
<li>At what point should I buy a larger aircraft for an established route (50-100 pax aircraft) &amp; how much larger should I go?</li>
<li>I bought a larger aircraft for a profitable &amp; 100% L/F route, now my profit plunged or I'm making a loss. My ticket prices are already equal to my competitors, what should I do?</li>
<li>Can freq increases, help a low profit route?</li>
<li>I have a championed airport which is a smaller airport, is it an advantage building a base there &amp; or adding an asset?</li>
<li>Is there any other advice on maintaining/increasing profit?</li></ol>
<p><b>Do's:</b> 
</p>
<ul><li>Think carefully, have a plan in mind as to where you want to establish routes &amp; bases.</li>
<li>Choose aircraft that will be sufficient (enough range/economical &amp; capacity) for the route's you are planning.</li>
<li>Research. Look at who is flying on a proposed route, what the freq's are, capacity they are carrying, ticket pricing, assets they may have &amp; use the research tab &amp; check demand.</li>
<li>Use a slow &amp; steady approach to expanding your airline, things can go badly very quickly when you make a mistake.</li>
<li>Want to expand a base, new big shiny aircraft? Think you could use a bank loan? Check your income/cash flow &amp; make sure you can afford the repayments &amp; don't forget the added cost of whatever it is you are taking the loan out for.</li></ul>
<p><b>Don't:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Get carried away building bases, they will seriously impact your profit before you are making enough money to cover the cost.</li>
<li>Get excited by shiny large aircraft eg: Boeing, Airbus with 150+ PAX while trying to establish new routes <i>(note this could be different establishing an long haul international route).</i></li>
<li>Open a route &amp; offer a extremely low price compared with competitors on the same route. It will be frowned upon by the Airline Club community &amp; you may find the big established airlines will be able to offer an even lower price (they can easily afford a loss), which will make things very difficult for you to re-establish the route at all.</li>
<li>Avoid large loans or in-fact any loans when you are starting out if possible.</li></ul></div>
