<h1>World Map</h1>
<hr>
<div class="mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The world map shows all the airports and routes by clicking on the World Map <a href="/wiki/Menus" title="Menus">menu</a>. 
</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Features">Features</span></h2>
<p>Every map will have the same parts.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Airports"><a href="/wiki/Airport" title="Airport">Airports</a></span></h3>
<figure class="thumb  show-info-icon" typeof="mw:File/Thumb" style="width: 450px"> 	<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/airline-club/images/8/84/Europe_Airport_map.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426160609" class="mw-file-description image"><img alt="Europe Airport map" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/airline-club/images/8/84/Europe_Airport_map.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/450?cb=20210426160609" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="450" height="253" class="thumbimage" data-image-name="Europe Airport map.png" data-image-key="Europe_Airport_map.png" data-relevant="1" /></a> 	 	<figcaption class="thumbcaption"> 		 			<a href="/wiki/File:Europe_Airport_map.png" class="info-icon"><svg><use xlink:href="#wds-icons-info-small"></use></svg></a> 		 		 		 			<p class="caption">Europe's major airports. (Nordics got cut off)</p> 		 	</figcaption> </figure>
<p>An airport will have an icon with an airplane in it. The darker an airport is, the more passengers the airport covers. Purple airports are gateway airports.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Routes"><a href="/wiki/Route" title="Route">Routes</a></span></h3>
<p>Routes are lines on the map that go from airport to airport. They can be in colors ranging from red to green. Red routes are routes with a constant deficit, orange are routes that have a deficit but were once profitable, and green routes are totally profitable.
</p><p>Routes may look curved on the map, but they are, in reality, straight. This is because the earth is curved, so a straight line from Sydney to London looks curved on a flat map. Note the routes don't take into account waypoints, restricted airspaces, etc.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Side_Buttons">Side Buttons</span></h2>
<p>There are other viewing options by toggling the buttons on the lower right hand side. Here are the features from top to bottom:
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Heat_Map">Heat Map</span></h3>
<p>This button will enable the influence heat map, showing the areas of where you have loyalists. Colors range from purple (least amount) to a yellow (highest amount). you can use the arrow buttons next to the week counter to go forwards or back in increments of 100 weeks (2 triangles) or 10 weeks (1 triangle).
</p><p>The Trend option shows where you're losing or gaining loyalists. Losing will be in a red color, and gaining will be in a blue color. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Champion">Champion</span></h3>
<p>When this mode is toggled, all airports will be replaced by an airline logo. These are the top airlines in these airports (you may need to hover to see which airport), as well as if there are any competitors who are trying to take the top spot (represented by a flame).
</p>
