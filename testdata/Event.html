<p>The Olympics are an international sporting event that occurs every 4 years, where athletes from countries all around the globe compete for medals in a variety of sports. In-game, the Olympics happens once every 4 years, although preparations (for airlines) starts way before the planned week.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Year_1">Year 1</span></h3>
<p>Once the last week of the Olympics finishes, the voting for the next Olympic begins. A selection of six towns/cities that are located above the -45 or 45 latitude line from different countries will be voted using a ranked-choice system (where the first place you click will be your most preferred city, second one you click will be the next preferred city, and so on and so forth). Airports that are open to serve the Olympics must be within a 100km radius.
</p><p>In order to vote, your reputation must be 40 or above. Otherwise, you will get a message saying you will be unable to vote.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Years_2_and_3">Years 2 and 3</span></h3>
<p>The winner from the vote from the previous year is announced, as well as which city was eliminated when. If a city was eliminated, it's votes go to the next-highest city that is still in the running (per person). If you voted (<b>regardless of which city you picked</b>), you get an option to claim a reward of either $10,000,000 or +10 loyalty in the host city's (and surrounding) airports<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>notes 1<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>.  See Said airports within the city range get an Olympic <a href="/wiki/Airport_Charm" title="Airport Charm">Airport Charm</a> which boosts demand. This will remain until the conclusion of the Olympics.
</p><p>These years are for preparation and planning. In this time, you can set up routes to the host city. However, you will not get any score from passengers transported at this time.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Year_4">Year 4</span></h3>
<p>This year you will be able to gain score. Score is based on the amount of passengers transported. If you reach your target score, you can claim a reward of $20,000,000 (or score, whichever one is higher), or a loyalty boost. Not every airline has the same target score.
</p><p>Score is about 1 point per passenger directly transported, 1/2 point if you transport a passenger for one part of a leg (transfers), 1/3 for three transfers, etc. Just because you have a certain amount of passengers to the target city, you will not always get the same amount points in return<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>notes 2<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>. In addition, note that each pax transported = 1 point, and route distance plays no role in determining the score, just the number of pax and the number of segments they travelled on.
</p><p>If you surpass the score goal, you get the option of choosing one of the four rewards: 
</p>
<ul><li>Cash $20,000,000 or $500*score (whichever one is higher)</li>
<li>Loyalty: +25 loyalty boost on airports in the 100km range of the host city for 4 years</li>
<li>Reputation: +10 reputation for a limited time</li>
<li>Delegates: Base of +3 delegates for 100% completion, and an additional delegate for each additional 100% of goal completed up to 400% for a maximum of 6 delegates (for 208 weeks, one full Olympics cycle)</li></ul>
<p>Choose wisely!
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Christmas">Christmas</span></h2>
<p>Around Christmas (usually beginning the first Saturday of December, until the first or second week of January), there is a mini-game that involves guessing where Santa is in the world, by clicking on airports. There is an option to enable snowflakes raining down across your screen as well<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>notes 3<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup>!
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mechanics">Mechanics</span></h3>
<p>The airports that can be a possible hiding spot have a scale of at least 6 and are in the top 300 airports in the world. You are allowed 10 tries to guess<sup id="cite_ref-:1_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-4"><span class="cite-bracket">&#91;</span>notes 4<span class="cite-bracket">&#93;</span></a></sup> and you will receive hints.

<p>Obviously, it's much more fun manually searching through the research tab and thinking of cities you know, then discovering just how far they are apart.
