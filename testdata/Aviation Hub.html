<h1>Aviation Hub</h1>

<div class="mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><br />
In v2.2, released August 23, 2025, the new aviation hub was added. Details below, summarized by Gemini.
</p><p><b>1. Basic Requirements to be a Hub:</b>
</p>
<ul><li><b>Enough Passengers:</b> An airport must have at least 10,000 passengers. If it has fewer, its hub strength is 0.</li></ul>
<p><b>2. Calculating the Hub Strength:</b>
</p>
<ul><li><b>The "Ratio" Score:</b> The code looks at the airport's total number of passengers (<code>pax</code>) compared to the number of people who want to fly directly from that airport (<code>directDemand</code>).
<ul><li>If there's <b>no direct demand</b> (<code>directDemand</code> is 0), the ratio score is a fixed value of 20. This is a special case to give airports with no direct flights a chance to be a hub.</li>
<li>If there <b>is direct demand</b>, the code calculates the ratio: <code>total passengers / direct demand</code>.
<ul><li>If this ratio is less than 2, the hub strength is 0. This means the airport is mainly serving people flying directly, not connecting passengers.</li>
<li>If the ratio is 2 or more, the code uses a mathematical formula (a logarithm) to calculate the ratio score. This formula rewards airports with a very high ratio (meaning they have lots of connecting passengers) but caps the score at 20.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><b>The "Passenger" Score:</b> The code then takes the "Ratio" score and multiplies it by a "Passenger" score.
<ul><li>The "Passenger" score is calculated by taking the airport's passenger count, but capping it at 500,000, and then dividing it by 75,000. This means larger airports get a bigger boost to their hub strength, but it doesn't increase infinitely.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Final Result:</b> The final hub strength is the product of the "Ratio" score and the "Passenger" score, capped at a maximum of 100.</li></ul>
<p><b>What the Hub Strength Does:</b>
</p><p>For every point of "Aviation Hub Strength" an airport has:
</p>
<ul><li>It increases the airport's reputation by 0.25.</li>
<li>It increases the population it serves by 20,000.</li>
<li>It increases the airport's income by $100.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Direct_demand">Direct demand</span></h3>
<p>You can use the passenger score of airports, for airports without aviation hub, to calculatw their exact total direct demand. This is equal to required passengers / 2, if the requirement &gt; 10,000 passengers.
